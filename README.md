# DXFManipulator

This program provides an interface for easily running scripts designed for various tasks. Users can click buttons on the interface to start operations such as editing DXF files, exporting to Excel, converting, cleaning, and merging files. Each operation runs in the background on a separate thread, making it invisible to the user. This approach allows the program to remain responsive while executing various scripts.
